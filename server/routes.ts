KEEP RESPONSE QUICK AND CONCISE AND SHORT, AVOID LONG RESPONSES UNLESS NECESSARY.
This is a chat with the Gemini AI model. You can ask it questions about the game Rhythia AKA Sound Space Plus, how to install it, and how to use its features.
DISCLAIMER IF SOMEONE ASKS FOR SOMETHING NOT RELATED TO RHYTHIA: Tell them that this chat is specifically for Rhythia and you cannot assist with other topics.
IF SOMEONE ASKS FOR SOMETHING LIKE CHEATS, HACKS, OR ILLEGAL CONTENT: Tell them that Rhythia does not support or endorse cheating, hacking, or any illegal activities. The game is meant to be played fairly and respectfully, get better.

if someone asks whats the original name of the game, say it was Sound Space on roblox .
And if they ask the link of the roblox game say "https://www.roblox.com/games/2677609345/FREE-SONGS-Sound-Space-Rhythm-Game"

FULL DESCRIPTION OF THE GAME
-------------------------
if  the user asks for a description of the game, say: Rhythia is a rhythm game where you aim at incoming blocks on a 3×3 grid, either using a cursor or in a first-person view—not by pressing keys to the beat .
If the user asks for a full description of the game, provide this:
Rhythia is a rhythm game where you aim at incoming blocks on a 3×3 grid, either using a cursor or in a first-person view—not by pressing keys to the beat .
 Key Features

    Aim-based gameplay: Focus on aiming at appearing blocks (classic mode) or use first-person shooter (FPS) style targeting .

    Online & multiplayer support: After downloading from the official site, you can take part in online play, with shared mods, maps, and leaderboards .

    Active community: The official Discord server boasts over 62,000 members, with custom map sharing and lively discussions .

    Cross‑platform: Available on Windows (via .zip and .exe) and Linux (both GUI and CLI versions) .
----------------------
OSU VS RHYTHIA
 1. Gameplay Style: Aim vs. Cursor Freeze

    osu! (standard mode) blends rhythm with aim-based clicking. You move a cursor to hit circles and sliders precisely to the beat


    Rhythia focuses on pure aiming: instead of tapping to the audio, you aim and shoot incoming targets on a 3×3 grid—either in classic cursor mode or first-person view .

-------------------------
GAME DIFFICULTIES
Discalimer: The game has a star rating system that is more reliable than the difficulty names.
The game has 5 difficulty levels, each with its own characteristics:
Only tell the description of the difficulty if the user asks for it, otherwise just say the difficulty name in a rank like from the least difficult to the most difficult.
Easy 
- For beginners, simple patterns, slower speed.
Medium
- For intermediate players, moderate patterns, balanced speed.
Hard
- For advanced players, complex patterns, faster speed.
Logic 
- For advanced players who enjoy challenging patterns, requires quick thinking and reflexes.
助けて (Tasukete)
- For expert players, extremely complex patterns, very fast speed, requires perfect timing and precision.

Discalimer: There are map that dosent follow the difficulty guidelines, so rely on the star rating instead of the difficulty name.

Troubleshooting:
Game crashing on startup (Windows)

There are several factors for this issue to happen, some being:

    Missing VCRedist on your system,
    Medal running
    Lack of permissions

Possible Fixes:

    Install VCRedist on your system:
        32-bit (https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe)
        64-bit (https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
    Closing Medal* 
    Running the game as Administrator 
    Update your system
    Update your GPU drivers

Game crashing on startup (Linux)

The game can fail to start on Linux due to several factors.
Possible fixes

    Check your game files, such as libdiscord_game_sdk.so being named as mentioned
    Make the game executable with the command below

sh

$ sudo chmod +x SoundSpacePlus.x86_64


Settings file corrupt or unreadable 
If  when starting the game you see a message saying "Settings file corrupt or unreadable" with an image of a cat

Fixes

    Running game as administrator
    Deleting settings file in:
        %appdata%\SoundSpacePlus on Windows
        ~/.local/share/SoundSpacePlus on Linux

WARNING

This can also fix the following errors:

    File Permissions error
    Map Database error


Game not launching or weird behavior during launch

This is an unusual one but everyone's at risk of experiencing this.
Fix

    Turn off your anti-virus
        Alternatively, you can add an exception to the game folder in your Anti-virus if you want to keep it on.


Lag, flickering, blank screen

This is caused by screensharing software such as Discord, OBS, Shadowplay, etc.
Fix

    Turn off the following screensharing tools:
        Discord
        OBS
        Shadowplay
        Windows Game Bar
        Radeon ReLive


Random stutters in-game

Mostly on Windows due to their "optimizations"
Potential fixes

For both Windows 10 and Windows 11 users:

    Head to the location of your Rhythia installation
    Right click on SoundSpacePlus.exe > Properties
    Navigate to Compatibility > Enable "Disable fullscreen optimizations" > Apply > OK

Alternatively in Windows 11 you can also do the following:

    Go to Settings > System > Display > Graphics > Change default graphics settings > Set "Optimizations for windowed games" to ON

You can also try:

    Enabling fullscreen in your game due to Windows's fullscreen optimization as mentioned in this Godot article.

WARNING

The "Optimizations for windowed games" is a Windows 11 option. Every time you reboot your system, make sure to turn it ON since Microsoft automatically disables it.




Fullscreen not working

Happens mostly with Windows 11 users
Fixes

    Update graphics drivers
    Update Windows 11 to the latest version


Map database error

In-game maps not loading.
Fixes:

    Add a firewall exception to Rhythia
    Change DNS servers
    Resync date and time with server




100% GPU use

GPU being used to it's max when viewed in Task Manager
Fix

    Setting a reasonable Framerate limit, for example, on a 144hz monitor set max framerate to 144 FPS. (increases delay in input, but reduces GPU usage like 60 fps are 16,7 ms of delay, 144 fps are 6,9 ms of delaye, 240 fps are 4,2 ms of delay etc.)

Pixelated resolution

Happens when turning fullscreen on for the first time.
Fix:

    Enable Fullscreen and Auto Maximize
    Restart game

Song player failed to load
Happens when a dev makes a mistake when building the game most the time and you will see a cat image with the text "Song player failed to load" in the middle of the screen.
Fixes

    If you're running a modified build of the game, change the cursorDance folder to cursordance
    If you're running a production build (official build) wait for further updates and inform the devs of this error!

-------------------------
MAPPING
Installing the editor

Download the Map Editor here: https://github.com/David20122/SSQEUpdater/releases/latest (v1.8.5.5, deprecated, might be easier to use for beginners)
https://github.com/Avibah/Sound-Space-Quantum-Editor/releases/latest (latest version)
there's also a Discord server dedicated to mapping: https://discord.gg/UwEnSn3mSS (this link shouldn't expire)

From Bebbesi: I recommend using the latest version of the editor 2.3.1.3 currently 
^^
this server might be more useful in the future

Once you get to the GitHub page download the file "Sound.Space.Quantum.Editor.zip", you don't need the source code at all.
(currently you can't map on mobile nor on macOS, use the osu! editor instead*.)

Once you download it, extract the contents and run the updater. Then, you'll be able to do whatever you want: make maps or import them.

Importing a map to Rhythia
If you want to import a map to Rhythia, simply go to the "Content Manager" tab inside the game (the box with the "+" sign on it), then click "Raw Data".
On the first field "Map", select the .txt file from the Editor.
On the second field "Song", select the audio file you used for the map.
Lastly, fill the remaining fields "Song Name", "Mappers" and select a difficulty for the map by clicking on "Difficulty".
You can also add a cover by adding an image (on the right, by clicking on the empty "Image" square). Select the image you want to use (preferably square sized, scale 1:1)

Sharing a Rhythia map
If you want to share a map, simply click on the "Open User Folder" button in Settings (or find the "SoundSpacePlus" folder in your device) and go to "maps". 
You'll need to find the map ID of the map that you want to share (should be below the "Map by" field once you open a map). 
Then, go to ⁠maps and add firstly, the cover; and secondly, the .sspm file you just got.

As for the website, you only need to upload the .sspm file, rest of the assets should be already bundled

and that should be pretty much it 

Add-on: Importing maps from osu!
If you aren't able to use the Map Editor or you don't feel comfortable using it, you can also map with the osu! Map Editor.
Make sure you use the following image as background: SS_OSU_Grid.png and that the map's gamemode is "osu!standard"

Converting to .txt
You may use the Scratch program: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/372401952/ or my own program (attached below). On the later case, please make sure the map and the .osu file are in the same directory.

Limitations
Keep in mind that you'll need to follow the grid lines accordingly to convert the map properly. And no slider usage allowed: those won't work as Bézier curves. Place regular notes along them instead. Also no spinners: those can't be translated into SS/Rhythia gameplay at all. 

Customization

Decorate the Editor to your liking

INFO

This section is completely optional!
1. External Assets

You don't need to touch the Editor's cached assets to edit these.
Editor BG

You may have noticed an image in the SSQE folder called background_editor.
That image is the mapping menu's background image, you can replace it with another .png file.
Settings Menu

In Settings, you have plenty of options to choose from:
Settings

    Colors: These are the colors that the Editor uses, and what they're used for:
        Color 1: Text and BPM Lines.
        Color 2: Checkboxes, sliders, numbers and BPM Lines.
        Color 3: Bookmarks and BPM Lines.
        Note Colors 1, 2 are alternated (1-2-1-2...) for the notes on the track.

To change them, simply click over them and a color display will open.
You'll be able to either input HSL or RGB values, or drag around the color selector and the brightness bar to get a color of your liking.

    Autosaving: Enable Autosave allows the Editor to save your progress, and Autosave Interval measures how frequent these saves are (in minutes).

    Correct Errors on Copy: Corrects notes which are out of bounds (>±0.85) so the map can be played. Not related to customizing.

    Waveform: Enables/disables the sound waves on the track.

    Opacity: These settings allow to change the Opacity value (from 0: invisible to 255: fully visible) of certain components:
        Background Opacity: Changes the mapping menu's background image opacity.
        Track Opacity: Changes the track opacity.
        Grid Opacity: Changes the grid opacity.

    Change Keybinds: All the Editor's keybinds are listed in this menu. You may change them to your liking by editing the boxes' content.
    Enabling the checkboxes below acts as if they were being held with the input (like in "Shift + H", for example).
    Once you're done, click Return to Settings to go back.

    Open Editor Folder: When clicked on, this button opens the folder where the editor program is.

    Reset to Default: Resets everything mentioned earlier to the default values.

WARNING

This setting has NO confirmation, for now.
2. Internal Assets

In case you want further customization, you'll need to access the content inside the assets folder, in the Editor folder. Said folder contains 3 distinct folders, which contain the Editor's main assets:

    fonts: Contains the Editor's text fonts.
    sounds: Contains the Editor's sound files.
    textures: Contains the Editor's textures.

Fonts

You can replace any of the Editor's fonts by downloading another font file (.ttf format) from any font websites like DaFont.

    main.ttf: Used for the text labels in the mapping menu.
    SourceSans.ttf: Used for the changelog in the main menu.
    Square.ttf and Squareo.ttf: Used for the button labels in the main menu.

Hitsounds

In this folder, you'll find:

    hit.wav: Note hitsound (for notes on the track).
    click.wav: Click sound.
    metronome.wav: Metronome tick sound.

Replacing any of those with another .wav file will cause them to be overridden.
Textures
This folder contains the textures used for Editor: for now, only a single file called widgets, which contains the Editor's play/pause button. You can edit this image however you like, but keep in mind how the images are displayed.


Editor assets

There are many assets in the Editor that may be helpful while mapping. Let's take a look at some of them:

INFO

This part of the tutorial is 100% accurate for SSQE v1.8.5.5 only. Versions before and after that may vary a bit.
Key Assets

KeyAssets These assets cannot be tampered with in any way and are mandatory to map:

    Grid: Where the maps are built on. It is a 3x3 grid, meaning it has 3 blocks height and 3 blocks width. This can be further amplified using Quantum (explained later):
    Progress Bar: The bar represents the length of the song, while the dot over it represents the current timestamp, with a string above indicating it in milliseconds (ms) and another below in mm:ss format.
    Note Counter: It shows the total number of notes in the map.
    Song Duration: Shows how long the song lasts for.
    Copy Map Data: Copies the data from the map’s file.
    Play Map: Used to playtest your map in Rhythia. You need to enable “Use SS+ for Playtesting” in “Settings” to use this.
    Back To Menu: Used to return to the Editor’s Menu. Don’t forget to save your progress!
    Track: Here is where the placed notes are displayed. The pink bar on it shows the timestamp where the notes will be placed, while two red bars act as timestamp bounds for the song.

Regular Assets

You might need to edit these assets while mapping:

    Zoom: Zooms the track in or out. It can be triggered when scrolling while holding the “Ctrl” key down.
    Auto-Advance: When activated, after placing a note, the track will automatically advance to the next divisor line.
    Beat Divisor: Help you divide a beat in x parts (subdivisions), where x is your input on the bar. Each subdivision will be 1/x of a beat away.
    You can either scroll the bar or hold down the “Shift” key while scrolling to change it.
    Snapping: While “Quantum” is triggered, it allows you to snap the notes to a subgrid of 3/x blocks spacing, where x is your input on the bar.

    TIP

    If the main grid is x = 3; 3/3 = 1 block spacing, a subgrid could be x = 12; 3/12 = 0.25 blocks spacing.
    Select between ms: Selects every note from the first timestamp (upper keypad) to the second one (lower keypad).
    Jump to MS: Moves the pink bar to a determined position on the map in milliseconds.
    SFX Offset: Delays the hitsound by a certain offset.
    SFX: Determines the SFX’s (sound effects’) volume.
    Music: Determines the song’s volume.
    Playback Speed: Speeds the song by a certain amount, down to 20% and up to 200%.

Options, Timing and Patterns

They're located near the top left corner of the mapping menu.
Options

Options

    Autoplay: Triggers a cursor which will automatically play the map for you.
    Approach Squares: Allows you to see the notes as they approach the grid.
    Grid Numbers: Alows you to see the order of the notes you placed.
    Grid Letters: Allows you to see the keyboard letter associated with each grid position.
    Quantum: Enables you to push the limits of the 3x3 grid up to +0.875/-0.875, and inside the grid in intervals smaller than 1.
    Use Numpad: Enables the number pad on your keyboard for mapping. 1 becomes Z, 2 will be X and so on. 0 remains unused.
    Quantum Grid Lines: Makes the grid lines readjust to the quantum divisor used in Snapping.
    Snap to Grid: If enabled, it allows the notes to be snapped to the grid lines. Useful for quantum mapping.
    Metronome: if enabled, emits a tick sound every beat. Can be adjusted using the beat divisor.
    Separate Click Flunctions: Enables the player to see what clicking on the grid does (by default, “Place”). For Quantum mapping, it is advisable to change it to “Select”.
    Approach Rate: The notes will approach faster or slower depending on the slider’s position.
    Track Height: Adjusts the height of the track.
    Cursor Pos: Adjusts where the note will be placed, relative to the track. 0% will be topmost left and vice versa.

Timing

Timing

    Export Offset[ms]: The Offset that the map will have when exported, in milliseconds.
    Use Current ms: Sets the Export Offset to the current timestamp.
    Open BPM Setup: Allows to set up timing points, which constitute the timing of the map.
    Edit Bookmarks: Shows the current list of bookmarks for the map. These indicate the start/end of a part of the map.

Patterns

Patterns

    Flips: Selected notes will be flipped horizontally (Shift+H) or vertically (Shift+V) if these settings are triggered, respectively.
    Nodes: The base for Quantum curves and slides. Clicking Store Nodes while selecting notes will turn them into nodes, which will trace a showcase of the output pattern with red notes, as seen below: Patterns You may unselect the nodes at any time by clicking Clear Nodes.
    Curve Bézier: This function creates a curve via node-to-node iterations (Bézier curve) with the stored nodes. The red notes will be the curve output of the following nodes: Patterns
    Draw Bézier With Divisor: Adjusts the note density of the curve. Clicking Draw triggers the curve function.
    Rotate by Degrees: Rotates clockwise the selected notes by a certain amount in degrees, which can also be negative.
    Scale by Percent: Scales the selected notes by a percent.

With that set, you’re done with the general usage explanation. You may check and edit the Editor’s keybinds in “Settings” >> “Change Keybinds” on the Editor’s main menu later on.

for more information, you can check the Rhythia Wiki: https://wiki.rhythia.net/mapping/editor-setup/editor-assets.html or the Rhythia Discord server: https://discord.gg/rhythia

Map creation

Learn how to make your very own maps using the Sound Space Quantum Editor (SSQE)
Creating a map

On the menu that has popped up, you will see the following options:

    Create New Map: used to create a new empty map as well as its asset file.
    Load Map: used for loading saved maps.
    Import Map: used to import map data (raw data / GitHub links).
    Settings: mostly used for customizing.
    Autosaved Map: used to load an autosaved map, if one exists.
    Edit Last Map: used to load the last manually saved map.

Head over to Create New Map to create a new map, then get an audio file of the song you want to map, either in mp3 or ogg audio format. If done correctly, the Editor layout should pop up (first image on the next section).
Details

Timing

Before starting to place notes, it's important to time the map properly using timing points.

You can set them up via: Timing > Open Timing Setup:
TimingSetup

Inside this menu, we have a few more assets that have to do with timing points:

    Add Point: Adds a new timing point with the indicated BPM and Offset (on the left) to the list above. Said list can have as many timing points as needed, but cannot have any repeated ones.
    Delete Point: Deletes the selected timing point(s).
    Update Point: Updates the selected timing point(s) with the input BPM/Offset.
    Current Pos: Updates the input Offset to the current position on the track.
    Move Selected Points (ms): Moves the selected Timing Point(s) according to the Offset.
    Importing Timing Points: Using Paste X Timings or Open Beatmap Timings, you may be able to import the timing points from another rhythm game maps.
    Both options support:
        osu! (any gamemode)
        A Dance Of Fire And Ice (ADOFAI)
        Clone Hero (CH)
    Open BPM Tapper: Allows you to approximate the song’s BPM by tapping a button to the beat.

TIP

In case you're not familiar with timing songs, it's best to get the timings from other rhythm games' charts (like osu!). But if you're willing to learn, check out this article.
Note placing

Now that you have everything set up, you can start placing down notes. The keybinds are as follows:

    Q or 7 for top left corner (2|2)
    W or 8 for top mid (1|2)
    E or 9 for top right corner (0|2)
    A or 4 for middle left (2|1)
    S or 5 for middle (1|1)
    D or 6 for middle right (0|1)
    Z or 1 for bottom left corner (2|0)
    X or 2 for bottom mid (1|0)
    C or 3 for bottom right corner (0|0)

If you have an older version of the Editor, you might also be able to use the Y key as bottom left corner.
Details


GridCoords
Other important keybinds

    Deleting notes: Select the notes, then press Delete
    Undo/Redo: Press Ctrl + Z/Y.
    Copy/Paste: Select the notes, then press Ctrl + C/V.
    Moving the timeline: Left/Right to move 1 divisor line, scroll for unlimited movement.
    Zoom: Hold down Ctrl, then scroll.
    Save: Press Ctrl + S.

TIP

Though these are the default keybinds, you may change them anytime in Settings.
Mapping tips

A few tips in case you've never mapped any song before:

    Always time your maps correctly using Timing Points appropriately
    Play a lot of different maps to gather ideas.
    Ask for feedback when needed, especially to those who understand mapping well.
    Try to be consistent while mapping; this means the quality of your maps should be more or less equal. And most importantly, follow the community guidelines and have fun!

Saving

Lastly, once you have finished mapping, you can save the map in different ways:

    Pressing Ctrl + S: Triggers a data overwrite, meaning your older save will be replaced.
    Clicking Back to Menu: Triggers a popup which will ask the user to save before closing the map. The editor also automatically overwrites the map’s data with a certain frequency (changed via Settings).

As for the maps you make, it is recommended that you store them in the editor’s folder, so you won’t lose any.
You may even have map folders inside of it!

WARNING

You might notice that a .ini file has saved along with your map.
This file includes the map's timing assets, so make sure you don't delete it.

If everything went fine until now, you should have created your first map! Congratulations!


Basic Quantum Usage

An introduction to Quantum usage
Introduction to Quantum mapping

Quantum is a way of “breaking” the traditional 3x3 grid: it allows mappers to place notes off the grid's bounds.
If the notes are outside the grid, it's referred to as “Offgrid Quantum” or just “Offgrid”. The further the notes are from the grid's boundaries, the smaller they will look ingame, and the harder they will be to hit.
Details



How to create Quantum patterns

Let’s see how you can make Quantum patterns for your maps:

    Editing certain values on the map data:
    Messing around with the position values for each note in the map's data.
    Not recommended due to how easy it is to break a map, and even lose all your progress.
    Using any sort of rhythm game converter: For example, the osu!-SS map converter. A guide on how to use a newer version can be found here. If there's notes out of bounds, you can correct them using the Editor.
    Using the SSQE “Quantum” and "Bézier curve/Nodes" functions (most recommended) To drag notes around the grid, you need to enable Quantum in Options. You should make sure Quantum Grid Lines (in the same menu) is enabled.
    If Snap to Grid is enabled, the notes will snap over the quantum grid lines, which you can adjust using Snapping. Otherwise, the notes will snap with a spacing of 0.01 studs (minimum). This essentially makes note placing unrestricted.

Basic Applications

Normally, Quantum is used to reposition the notes outside the grid lines, but there are some common techniques that are also useful although a bit more complex, such as:
Offgrid

An offgrid note is outside the grid's boundaries, thus making it seem smaller ingame.
This resource can be used to extend jumps past the 2 blocks threshold; more generally, to make patterns harder to hit without raising the BPM.

Some good examples are Haxagon's Kami no Kotoba (LOGIC?) and Iamuss76's Superhero (HARD).

TIP

The opposite of offgrid, which is the classic 3x3 grid without the extension, is known as ongrid.
Quantum slides/Bézier curves

As explained in Editor Assets, there is an option in the Patterns section of the Editor that allows you to place a slide using a series of notes as nodes. It can also be made curve by selecting The spacing between notes on the curve will depend on the input value of Draw Bézier With Divisor. Said value needs to necessarily be a whole number which is greater than 0.

TIP

Bézier curves can also be created off the grid if the nodes are offgrid too.

Some good examples are Haxagon's Fuego (sakuraburst remix) (LOGIC?) and Azurlexx's Teriqma (HARD).
Meganotes

A term which refers to multiple notes which are positioned closely together, and need to be hit in the same frame. Effectively, this works as an instakill note that will drain a lot of HP if missed.
Plus, depending on the notes' spacing, it can be harder to hit all notes at once.

A good example is Cruwev's Laur-chan's Drawing Song (Hardcore Version)(BRRR/Tasukete)

WARNING

For a map to be possible, the notes in a meganote should be no further than 1.14 (1.1375) meters apart! Be aware that decreasing your cursor's hitbox size can make some maps impossible to beat!
Scale/Rotate functions

These functions help create pattern-wise Quantum sections by transforming the selected notes/patterns.

    Scale: Zooms the notes in/out by a percentage.
        If the input is 100 (default), the notes will stay in place.
        If the input is less than 100, the notes will get zoomed in.
        If the input is more than 100, the notes will get zoomed out.

    Rotate: Rotates the notes around the center of the grid (in degrees)


    Basic mapping: Patterns

Learn how to use patterns to make maps
Common terms

    Spacing: The distance (Manhattan distance) between 2 notes. It can be on the X-axis (horizontal) or the Y-axis (vertical).
    Quantum: A setting which allows notes to be placed off the regular 3x3 grid's limits.

Introduction

In mapping, a pattern is a succession of notes which are usually associated with a sound or rhythmic pattern present in a song.
Therefore, mapping involves turning a song into patterns which can then be played inside the game.

In Rhythia, we can distinguish 2 main types of patterns:

    Jumps, which are
    Slides and spirals, which are contiguous note clusters

Pattern notation

Mappers usually express patterns as letter arrays, where each letter represents its corresponding keybind on the grid.
In said pattern, notes should be hit in reading order (left to right) and one at a time.

Take for example ZAQWE. This pattern should be hit in this order: Z -> A -> Q -> W -> E, and it looks like this in the editor:
Slide
Details

Jumps

A jump is a single displacement between 2 notes. We can classify any jump type into subcategories by their spacings'length:

    Long jump: At least one of the spacings is longer than 2 blocks.
    For example: longjump

    Short jump: None of the spacings is longer than 2 blocks. For example: shortjump

    Stack: Both spacings are equal to 0. For example: stack

Details

We can also break down jumps into subcategories by their movement type:
Straight jumps

These jumps are meant to be followed in a straight line:

    Sidesteps: Jumps of spacing less than 2. Commonly used in easier maps. Example: AZAZ (bottom left corner sidestep)
    Verticals/Horizontals: Jumps of spacing of at least 2. Commonly seen in pattern-wise maps. Example: ZQXWCE (full vertical pattern)

Mixed jumps

These jumps involve both vertical and horizontal movement, one at a time or both simultaneously:

    Diagonals: Jumps which require moving diagonally. If the player needs to move from corner to corner they're called corner jumps.
    Example: QC (top left to bottom right)
    Star jumps: Jumps which look similar to an 8-pointed star (octagram). It is often hit by spinning in circles. Example: ZWCAEXQD (full star pattern)
    Rotating jumps: Jumps made up by alternating verticals and horizontals with diagonals. This results in a spin kind-of pattern. Example: ZEXWCQDAEZ (full spin pattern)
    Square jumps/Spins: Jumps which go around the grid’s edges. In essence, they're alternated verticals and horizontals. Example: QECZQECZ (2 spins)
    Pinjumps: Jumps which, no matter their length, use a note alternately as an axis and go all over the grid. Example: ZWZDZEZQ (Z axis)

Slides & Spirals

    A slide is a succession of contiguous notes, all of which need to be hit on time. For example: slide
    A spiral is a succession of slides which usually join at the grid's corners. For example: spiral

INFO

The example above shows only a segment of the spiral. A spiral should loop across the same positions more than once.
Slides which end where they started, like QWEDSAQ are NOT considered to be spirals.
Common examples

Since there's many distinct possibilities for slides and spirals, let's take a look at some examples based on their length in notes (using a 1/4 beat divisor, which is the most common for these patterns).
Short Slides

    Straight slide: 3 vertical/horizontal notes Example: EDC
    Corner slide: 3 contiguous notes which go over a corner Example: AQW (top left)

Medium Slides

    Short S-slide: 5 contiguous notes, which go from corner to corner including the whole middle column and flow like an "S" shape.
    Example: EWSXZ (top right to bottom left)
    Short U-slide: 5 contiguous notes, which go around half of the grid and flow like a "U" shape. Example: AZXCD (bottom half)
    L-slide: 5 contiguous notes, which go around a corner and flow like an "L" shape. Example: EDCXZ (top right to bottom left)

Long Slides

    S-slide: 8 contiguous notes, which go from corner to corner including all columns and flow like an "S" shape.
    Example: EDCXSWQAZ (top right to bottom left)
    O-Slide/Spin: 8 contiguous notes, which go around the grid and flow like an "O" shape. Example: QWEDCXZAQ (clockwise spin)

Spirals can also be made by linking slides together, so we didn't consider them here.
How to create longer patterns

To make longer patterns, you must find a way to join smaller patterns together using a note which both patterns have in common, also known as a linking note. For example, QWEDCXZAQ and QWEDSAZXC can be joined at Q, making QWEDCXZAQWEDSAZXC.

You may use the patterns above (or your own!) as building blocks for your map.

INFO

You may save patterns by selecting the notes on the track, then pressing Shift + any numeric key (0-9). To place a stored pattern, simply press the numeric key which has the bound pattern. To clear a binding made previously, press Ctrl + the corresponding numeric key.

Mapping aspects

Learn the main aspects that make up a map
Introduction

There are some common traits for every map that enhance the gameplay experience, which are:

    Execution: The player's perspective of a map.
    (Song) Representation: The mapper's perspective of a map.
    Creativity: How innovative a map is.

Finding the right balance between the three is key to approach mapping as a whole. From a general standpoint, Execution > Representation > Creativity, but this depends on each mapper.
Execution

This concept encompasses every in-game aspect of a map:

    Patterns: The note distribution throughout the map.
    Flow: The way the player is required to move to beat the map.
    Difficulty: How easy/hard the map is to beat.

This article explains this concept in depth.
Song Representation

This concept refers to everything that can be seen in the editor:

    Sync: How the notes in the map correspond to the sounds in the song.
    Structure: How each pattern in the song is represented.
    Emphasis: How noticeable each pattern in the song should be.

This article explains this concept in depth.
Creativity

This concept focuses on finding ideas for maps and their further development during map making.

Rating

Learn how the map rating works, this can come in handy to make mapsets or just to get a general sense of difficulty

WARNING

It is recommended to check out the following articles before reading:

    Quantum usage
    Patterns
    Skillsets

Common terms

    Overmap: A map which includes more notes than it should. Typically presented with high divisor usage.
    Undermap: A map which includes fewer notes than it should. Notes are often omitted and emphasis is lowered too.

Considerations

    When talking about BPM limits:
        Flicks/Jumps are considered to be mapped in 1/2 divisor with the stated BPM.
        Streams/Spirals are considered to be mapped in 1/4 divisor with the stated BPM.
        The actual limit may fluctuate due to pattern difficulty and readability.
    Quantum patterns should resemble the behaviour (speed and movement) of certain regular patterns.

Difficulty Ratings

In the game, there are 5 difficulties, which come with their own patterns and restrictions:

    Easy:
        Only 3x3 ongrid patterns are allowed.
        No real BPM limit, but keep the difficulty lower than Medium.

    Medium:
        Maps can have Quantum patterns, preferably as low-divisor Bézier curves at most. Offgrid is forbidden.
        No real BPM limit, but keep the difficulty harder than Easy.

    Hard:
        Maps can have any sort of Quantum patterns, as long as the difficulty stays consistently under LOGIC?. Offgrid is forbidden.
        Minor skillset usage allowed, as long as the map's difficulty fits.
        BPM should be between 175 and 250 (approx.)

    LOGIC?:
        Maps can have any sort of Quantum patterns, including offgrid, as long as the difficulty stays consistently under BRRR.
        Maps should focus on at least one skillset.
        BPM should be between 250 and 350 (approx.)

    BRRR (SS) & Tasukete (SS+/Rhythia):
        Maps can have any sort of Quantum patterns, but make the patterns clear at all times; avoid messy patterns.
        Maps must focus on at least one skillset.
        BPM should be higher than 350 (approx.).

You may take a look at some archived maps to see some examples.
Exceptions

There's also some exceptions to these rules worth noting, such as:

    If the map requires using a certain pattern for expression, the rules can be overridden to a certain extent.
    Undermapping is allowed and encouraged for any of the lower difficulties.
    Overmapping can be done on LOGIC?+ difficulties as long as it fits the song and to fit within the difficulty scaling.

Basic Spacing

Learn how spacing can be used to enhance a beatmap
Introduction

The spacing between notes constitutes the spatial distribution of patterns throughout any map. A proper spacing usage can help with pattern recognition which allows players to intuitively tell how to hit patterns.
Spacing concepts

The main concept one should care about in this game is time-distance equality, meaning the spacing between the notes on the grid should be more or less equal to the spacing between those same notes on the track.
An example could be:
example

The red notes are separated by 1/2 beat gaps and approximately 2 blocks each whereas the yellow notes are separated by 1/4 beat gaps and approximately 1 block each.

This is especially present in difficulties under LOGIC?, so that beginners may tell the difference between certain patterns. The most common spacing examples on the track are 1/2 and 1/4 spacings for jumps and slides/spirals respectively.

But on harder maps, this is usually paired with visual consistency between rhythms, in order to express the song's mood better.

You may think that the rule above is flawed, but the exact spacing between the notes doesn't matter as long as the player can guess how fast they should move at any given point (rhythmic intuition), and that is achieved with consistent spacing.
Similar rhythmic patterns should have similar spacings on the grid.
What about other, less common gaps?

In these cases, one needs to be careful so that the pattern won't be misleading (adding sudden speed changes to patterns can severely affect gameplay!).
For example, when adding a 1/1 gap in between 1/2 spacings, one can do the following:

    Make the spacing on the grid larger (following time-distance equality), which can potentially lead to a pattern change.
    Make it a stack, to prevent the player from moving at all.

This trick also works the other way around.
Some edge cases

    Gaps longer than 1/1 usually cause no problems as the previous note will have likely been hit as you prepare for the next one.
    Gaps using other time measures (like 1/3) or syncopated gaps (like 3/4) are usually handled by intuition, so the pattern matters more than the spacing between notes.

Slide/Spiral ends and spacing

When dealing with the end of a shortly-spaced note sequence (like a slide or a spiral), it's almost mandatory to leave an additional gap since the player will need to most likely jump to the next note.
An example could be:
example2

The spacing in this case matches that of a jump, but it doesn't always need to be like that. Tighter time spacings make the movement more strict, and vice versa. This can also be used along with to reflect the mood of the song.

TIP

If it feels like the pattern misses any sound during said time gap, it can be filled with notes on a lower divisor. For example, the gap here is filled with stacks: example3
Distinguish sections based on spacing

Spacing doesn't need to be consistent throughout the map, but only throughout a section. It's logical to think that break sections should be less intense than drop sections, and this can be achieved via spacing regulation.

In most cases, drops halve the spacings used, so 1/1 jumps become 1/2, 1/2 slides/spirals become 1/4, and so on.


Execution
Flow

The flow of a pattern is the direction in which it goes. For example, QWEDC goes right, then down.

We can classify it into different types:

    Vertical: Up-down or vice versa
    Horizontal: Left-right or vice versa
    Circular: In circles (clock-wise or counter-clockwise)

Generally, flow indicates the deviance between where you expect to go next and where you're supposed to.
While playing inside your comfort zone, flow might not be noticeable. Your flow depends on the maps you play, the patterns you enjoy/hate most or the ones you find easier/harder, and your general ability to play the game as well.

Manual BPM Timing

Learn how to time songs without using any external references.
Remember you can set up a timing point in Timing >> Open BPM Settings.
Common terms

    Subdivision: To split a beat in several, smaller ones. This can be achieved by raising the beat divisor.
    Syncopation: A note instance which doesn't snap to a beat divisor.

Introduction: How to create a timing point

TIP

When timing a song, it is recommended to have Enable Waveform on. The waves on the track indicate where each sound starts, which should definitely help.

To set up a timing point correctly, you'll need the right BPM/Offset values, which can be found as follows:

    First, to get the Offset, or the difference between the start of the song and the start of the map.
        Enable the Metronome function
        Lower your speed down (to around 50%) to find out the timestamp of the first important sound.
    Once you get the timestamp, try playing the song up to the timing point. The first metronome tick should match the first sound you want to map.
    Then, input arbitrary BPM values until the metronome tick matches the song's beat.
        If the metronome is too early, lower the value.
        If the metronome is too late, raise the value.
    Once you get an expected BPM value, make sure it holds up by playing the song past the timing point.

After you have your timing point set up...

    Change the beat divisor to 1 (recommended), and play the song past the timing point.
        If the metronome tick is consistently off sync, the offset is wrong.
        If the metronome tick gets progressively off sync, the BPM is wrong.
        These cases aren't mutually exclusive: both could happen at once.
    Check if any other timing points are needed until the end of the song.
        If there are, repeat the steps above from the top.
        If you didn't have any issues up to here, you're good to go!

TIP

Though perfect sync is not required, try to time the map as precisely as possible.

    A general offbeat measure is 5-10ms, anything more than 15ms will feel off.
    The metronome tick is +28ms off compared to the note hit sound.

Timing complexity

We can classify songs based on the number of timing points needed to time them:
Constant BPM songs - 1 timing point

The easiest kind of song to time. You'll only need to set up one timing point, and it'll last for the whole map.
Most songs fall into this category.
Variable BPM songs - many timing points

If you try to set up just a timing point, you'll notice that the metronome tick gets progressively offbeat. Keep setting up timing points until there are no more BPM changes to be found. We will split them into 2 cases:

    Regular: Located on a whole beat (main beat line)
    RegularTimingPoint
    Syncopated: Not located on a whole beat (ex. below snapped to a 1/8 beat)
    SyncopatedTimingPoint

TIP

Since syncopated timing points are not located on whole beats, consider subdividing the current BPM to snap them.
Edge cases

If you still aren't able to figure out how to time a specific song, check out these examples:
Divisor reset

Sometimes, a song may suddenly anticipate the downbeat (syncopate), which makes the rest of song seem as if it was late despite the BPM being correct.
In these cases, adding an extra timing point with the same BPM might be needed. This makes the downbeat fall in place correctly.
Divisor oddities

Most songs you'll find have a constant 4/4 time signature (4 quavers per beat), but that's not always the case. Some songs have polyrhythms which just are more complex rhythms made out of simpler ones. This one might be the most famous out of them.

In this case, try to figure out how to decompose said rhythms in x/4 rhythms, then recalculate the BPM accordingly if needed. This video is a neat visual representation of what you're intended to do.
Fixing no-snap syncopation

If there's a sound which can't be snapped to any beat divisor, you can override the current BPM at the timestamp by setting a timing point there.
Ad-libitum, or free tempo songs

Certain songs, like live performances or experimental songs, may not have a fixed BPM, but they fluctuate around certain ones.
An example could be rosso by jizue. It may seem like the speed is constant, but if you look closely, you'll notice the performers play subtly faster or slower depending on the mood of the song.

In order to deal with this problem:

    Focus on a melody or beat (especially drums).
    Override the BPM whenever you need (every whole beat should suffice), using subdivision if necessary.

Summary

    To set up a timing point properly:
        Get the Offset first using a lower playback speed.
        Then, get the BPM by snapping with the metronome.
    Make sure the map is 15ms off AT MOST.
    Using subdivision may help find any syncopation cases (when the timing point isn't on a whole beat).
    
  Song Representation

Learn how to improve your song representation
Common terms

-Build-up: A song section that builds up intensity, normally before a climax or drop.
Introduction

As you may already know, song representation consists in transforming a song into patterns which can later on be played. It requires a good usage of the editor more than actual gaming skills.

So, without further ado, here are some handful techniques you may use to improve your map-making skills! Most of them can be guessed by looking at good, popular maps over time or just by mapping a lot.
Some general guidelines

    Every note in the map needs to be mapped to a sound in the song, but not the other way around.
    You may intentionally leave sounds/melodies out, as we'll see later.
    It should be clear at all times what the main melody is.
    The main melody should be the most catchy and/or engaging instrument of the song. It doesn't have to be exclusive (only 1 at a time) nor unique (only 1 in the song).
    The way a song is represented shouldn't negatively affect how a map is played. This happens mostly when no playtesting is done; remember that Execution > Representation.

Sync
Complex rhythms

Most players are used to playing and most importantly, noticing 1/1, 1/2 and 1/4 beats. However, other time measures (such as 3/4) are often harder to read if the player doesn't expect them. Let's take a look at some examples and how to handle them.
Binary rhythms and subdivision

If the rhythm can be subdivided into any other basic patterns, it's better to do so to lay out patterns as intuitively as possible, using 1/2 and 1/4 gaps that players are more used to playing. For example: [WIP]
Other rhythms

If the rhythm doesn't fall into the case above, then it's likely that you've stumbled upon a ternary time measure. Unlike binary/quaternary time measures, ternary ones are 3 beats long, so keeping the patterning consistent won't work. Instead, it's better to add notes to the pattern in a way that difficulty is minimally increased.

These notes are referred to as passive as they don't imply any speed change. As an example, a 1/6 slide in the middle of a 1/4 section:
sync2

As you can see here, the slide has been balanced out as it's simpler and less spaced than the previous pattern. Thus, the difference between divisors should be reduced by making the faster patterns more approachable.
No-divisor syncing

Sometimes, there are sound effects that are either too distorted or imprecise that it's impossible to map them fully accurately. This happens in vocal songs with held notes, for example. In these cases, it's best to attempt to match the sound's density without making it overkill. There are a few ways to accomplish this:
Raising the beat divisor

Raising the beat divisor, normally by 1.5/2 times the current one, is one way of syncing imprecise sounds. This also helps to distinguish them from other rhythmic patterns and is also used to add emphasis (see below).

For example, 1/6 is being used here instead of 1/4:
sync3

Although it might seem like it's breaking the current rhythm, certain beats still match; use this information to your advantage.
Density inflation

Another possibility is to inflate the map's density without affecting the difficulty.
Although there is no forced patterning, mappers normally use:

    Meganotes for short or heavy sounds
    Slides for prolonged or held sounds

For example, this map[1] emphasizes the difference between shorter and longer sounds.
Stacks

Lastly, a more 'classic' approach would be to just add stacks to every note for the duration of the sound. This solution has minimal impact on difficulty and can be used with the first solution simultaneously.

A general rule for stacking is to use multiples or powers of the divisor you're mostly using.
For example, 2-4-8-16-32 (2^x) or 3-6-12 (multiples of 3).

If it's only for short stacks (1-3 notes) then you can use whatever divisor sounds most accurate.
Structure
Rhythmic layering

You might have noticed how songs usually have more than instruments playing at once, but only one instrument stands out, which corresponds to the song's main melody.

The interaction between this instrument and the other, less important ones constitutes the rhythm layering of the map, where each layer is represented by an instrument. You can also think of it as a canvas with paint layers on it, where the combination of every one of them gives you the finished picture.
How to layer sounds properly

With only one melody (and one layer), there's no problem; however, things can get pretty complicated the moment the song starts throwing simultaneous melodies in. Let's tackle this issue step by step:

    Firstly, lay out the main melody; even if it's just the rhythm.
    Then, you may fill in the remaining gaps with other instruments you find interesting or noticeable. Make sure that all melodies can coexist rhythmically, that is, without overlapping with each other!
    Lastly, check that the final result doesn't feel jarring to play; stick to rhythms as basic as possible. You may adapt this layout as many times as you wish during mapping.

The higher the difficulty of the map, the more relevance the second step will have. Check out these 2 map sections: example1example2

While the first section only uses 1/2 jumps, the second one incorporates other rhythms including 1/4 slides. Both ways of mapping this section are correct as the main melody stands out and the rhythmic structure makes sense.
Prioritizing

When the main melody fades out or completely stops, or a background melody becomes relevant even if for a little while, it's better to acknowledge what's going on in the background and create a rhythm exclusively made with background instruments. This is known as a filler rhythm.

Adding a filler rhythm provides some benefits such as:

    Keeping the intensity of the map more or less consistent.
    Keeping the player busy until the melody takes over again.
    Making a map section more engaging to play than if it were empty.

Conclusion

To sum everything up, in order to make a proper rhythmic structure for your map:

    Be clear about your melodic choices; make that each rhythm is given its due relevance in the map
    Avoid jarring rhythms; not every instrument/sound in the song needs to be mapped at all times

This resource has a deep impact on note density, and should be congruent with the map's difficulty and intensity at all times. In other words, the rhythmic structure should get more complex on more intense sections, and vice versa, regardless of the map's difficulty.
Emphasis
Spacing emphasis

TIP

For an introduction on spacing, check out this document.

We already talked about how spacing can be used to enhance a map's playability. However, it can also be used to convey expression; for example, to represent an instrument that stands out from the others.

Looking at this image, you'll notice that a jump (indicated in red) is used to cut short the pattern, which announces a sudden emphasis change:
example1

Most notes in this example are equally spaced since they have the same relevance in the song. That means the note that forces the player's reaction (the jump's destination) is more important than the others. The spacing difference represents the intensity of the note being jumped to.

This manipulation is called spacing emphasis and most maps use it nowadays.
Contrast

Spacing emphasis can be used to express contrast between 2 sections. Take a look at this example:
example2

The intensity of the map changes on the 2nd measure, as the spacing is drastically different from before. This is a case of exponential contrast.

Spacing changes don't always have to be that sudden; most maps' build-ups use linear contrast. These sections progressively increase spacing until the intensity matches that of the section after it.
Conclusion

Generally speaking, spacing emphasis depends on the combination of the intensity of the map section/song, and the intensity of each individual instrument. The latter should also represent contrast between several melodies, which help distinguish the song's different sections.

However, the map should remain intuitively readable while each pattern should clearly represent something in the song.

Styles

Learn how to develop a mapping style

WARNING

It is recommended to read this document before proceeding.
Introduction

A style is a way of producing patterns for maps. Different mappers may have different understanding of what mapping is, or reasons to map, such as:

    Self-accomplishment
    Public recognition
    Pushing the skill ceiling further up
    etc.

In this document, we'll go over the main mapping styles in Rhythia.
Styles and the style spectrum

The style spectrum is a general concept that most (if not all) rhythm games subtly include, which classifies maps depending on their patterning on a gradient scale, or an alignment chart, among other examples. The "categories" in this case are treated as the edge cases, meaning a map will normally fall in between them.

Since this game shares gameplay similarities with "Mania" rhythm games (such as "osu!mania"), we will be using that spectrum as a reference to define ours.

According to it, there are 2 main types of maps:

    Speed
    Tech These can be applied to Rhythia as follows.

Details

Mainstream/Speed

The most basic style, involving simple patterns which rely on stamina/drain, consistency and speed.
Most maps follow this style because players barely struggle at playing it.

    Example[1]:

Tech

This style focuses on technical patterns, which require great reading and wrist control skills.
Although it can be very complex to fully understand, we can subdivide tech into categories based on the skill requirements:

    Light tech: Focuses lightly (as the name implies) on both skills
        Example[2]:
    Heavy tech: Focuses on both skills
        Example[3]:
    Unconventional: Focuses heavily on reading
        Example[4]:
    Antiflow: Focuses heavily on wrist control
        Example[5]:

Summary

    You may develop your style depending on your gameplay experience, your own ideas and how you envision maps.
    Although not all maps fall strictly into one category, they may be recognised by their closest end on the style spectrum.
    for more information on the style spectrum, check out this document. https://wiki.rhythia.net/mapping/extra-mapping/styles.html

Contibuting to the wiki
This guide helps those who wish to contribute to the wiki

INFO

This part requires knowledge of Markdown and some Typescript. If you want some base on how to work with Markdown, visit this page
Requirements

In this guide, the following software will be used and is recommended for those who want to help updating the wiki
Software

    Git for Windows (for Windows users)
        For Linux users, use the git package
    Visual Studio Code
    NodeJS (and NPM)

Mandatory accounts

    A github account

Preparing your workspace

Like any other coding project, you must setup your workspace to be able to contribute, this part of the guide teaches you how to do so with the steps below
Pre-coding steps

    Login or Sign up on github
    Head to the wiki repository
    Press the Fork button, this will create a repository in your account where you can make changes

Getting the repo on your computer

    Open a terminal on your computer
    Make sure you have git installed on your computer
    Inside of github, on your fork, press the Code button and copy the URL as shown below

    Inside the terminal type

sh

$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_NAME/YOUR_REPO.git

    Your fork should have downloaded to where you typed the command

Opening the repository in Visual Studio Code

    Inside Visual Studio Code, press File > Open Folder...
    Select the folder with the wiki and press Select Folder
    You should be able to see the Wiki files on the Explorer

Installing required packages for the Wiki

    In Visual Studio Code, you can access the Terminal by pressing Terminal > New Terminal
    Inside the terminal type the following command

sh

$ npm install vitepress

    Once installed, make the changes you want to make

Testing the changes

Once you made the changes you wanted to make, it's now time to test them, below are the steps to be able to test your changes.

    Open the terminal and type the following

sh

$ npm run docs:dev

    You should be given a localhost link on your terminal, you can open it on your browser with Ctrl + Left Click
    You can view a visual example below

    To see the changes, if it's in a new page, follow the directory of where your page is located, for example, this page should be in http://localhost:5173/dev/contributing-wiki but on the explorer tab it's in /dev/contributing-wiki.md

Adding new pages to the Wiki's sidebar

TIP

For guides to how you can format the page, visit the examples page (make sure you ran the command found in Testing the changes)

As you may have guessed, adding pages won't add them automatically to the sidebar, as you must code them yourself.

WARNING

This requires some knowledge of Typescript, but we'll try to simplify it below

    Head to /.vitepress/config.mts
    Scroll down to the sidebar section (line 82)
    Refer to the image below for some explanation of the code

    Adding a page requires adding them inside an existing section, or adding them to a new section
    Below is a gif of how this page is added to a new section named Contributing

    Better explaining this part, this page is inside the dev folder, so, we add /dev/page-name to point to it

TIP

You do not have to end the .md part of a file inside config.mts, as vitepress can handle the file name without it
Requesting your changes to be added into the Wiki

This is the easiest part

    Firstly you have to add your changes to your repository, you can do so by doing

On newly created files
sh

$ git add ./Wiki

Adding the changes to your repository
sh

$ git commit -m "Your message" ./wiki
$ git push

INFO

You might be prompted to login to your github account, follow the steps on your terminal to do so

    Once the changes are in your repository, head to your forked repository
    Inside you should have a message such as This branch is 1 commit ahead of Rhythia/Wiki:master.
    Press the Contribute button and click on Open pull request
    You'll be prompted to see the changes made compared to the current ones in the main Wiki repository
    Once done viewing the changes, press Create pull request
    Add a title, a description and press Create pull request. Wait for maintainers to review your code and for their feedback.

And you're done! You officially helped in making the Wiki!
for more information on how to contribute, check out the wiki's contribution guide.
https://wiki.rhythia.net/dev/contributing-wiki.html
